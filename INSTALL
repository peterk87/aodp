ABOUT
      The Automated Oligonucleotide Design Pipeline (aodp) is an utility
      that generates oligonucleotide signatures for sequences in the FASTA
      format and for groups in a phylogeny in the Newick tree format.

COMPONENTS
      aodp contains the following components:
        - aodp core: a command-line application written in C++
        - the following perl utilities: clus, clado, tax2nwk

       clado
         generates an eps file from a phylogeny tree file in a Newick format.
         Nodes that have names ending in "*" are colored red.

       clus
         interprets the results of matches of experimental samples against
         cluster oligo signatures generated by "aodp"

       tax2nwk
         converts a taxonomy file into a Newick phylogeny tree.

      The latest version of aodp is available at the following locations:
        - https://bitbucket.org/aafc-mbb/aodp_release
        - http://skwez.com/aodp/latest

PREREQUISITES
      aodp should run on most UNIX systems. It has been tested on
      Ubuntu 16.04.

      On Ubuntu:
        $ sudo apt-get install g++ make perl bioperl blast2

      - aodp is built from source using C++11
      - The C++ standard library and associated utilities (e.g. make)
        are also needed.
      - clado, clus and tax2nwk use perl (5.10 or better), BioPerl and Blast+

      The ./configure script will generate errors for missing prerequisites.

INSTALLATION
        # Unpack the distribution archive, then enter the resulting directory.
        $ tar -xzf aodp-x.tar.gz
        $ cd aodp-x
        # Run the configuration script:
        $ ./configure
        # Build aodp:
        $ make
        # As a user with root privileges, install aodp. Example:
        $ sudo make install
        # If everything went well, you will be able to see the aodp manual:
        $ man aodp

      If you would like to point the installation to non-default directories
      (for example if you do not have root access to the machine), pass the
      following parameters to ./configure:

        $ ./configure BIN_TARGET_DIR=/home/myuser/bin \
        MAN_TARGET_DIR=/home/myuser/man/man1
